# try-transformers
I want to try to use transformers!

In 2021, as part of my final project for UChicago's Applied Data Analytics course, I trained a LSTM model to predict when jet engines would fail. I leveraged TensorFlow and NASA's CMAPPS data set, with the goal of just replicating what academic papers had done. At the time (looking for a product job and completing a dual MBA & CS master program) I was pretty short on time and my goal was to get the project done and understand how to use the tools.

It's been a 3 years and in that time a lot has changed, in my life and the field! 

## What are my goals?

1. Brush up on skills - As a PM at Deliverr, I got to wear all the hats in the world in pursuit of building and scaling our vision. The included writing a lot of python and SQL code. Since our acquisition by Flexport, I have far fewer opportunities to do this. I want to use this project to brush up on my technical skills as I get ready for my next role.

2. See if a trendy new model is better - Transformers have revolutionized ML - see LLMs. My limited understanding is that they are good at time series data. Perhaps they will be better for this application than LLMs? 

3. Explore new and different technologies - learn to use them, try to understand how they work, see if I a comparison yields something insightful. 

4. Shameless self promotion - PMs like to blog about themselves right? Never tried this before

## What is the plan?

1. Revisit the original project and code and scope changes - as I recall, most of the code serves to grab the data and format it for the models to use. In theory, I just need to swap out the model? But might be good to start fresh.

2. Models - Need to figure out how one trains a transformer. How many to use? How to set up architecture and model? Are there different packages I can try?

3. What esle? - on HN I've seen references to newer-than-transformer models like MAMBA. Could I use that?

4. Product insights - what have I learned? What was hard and a painpoint? What could have been made simple? What is transferable here to other things I've done?
